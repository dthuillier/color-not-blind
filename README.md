# Color(not)Blind

Color(not)Blind is a web app I created for my end of boot camp project.

I wanted to develop a tool for visually impaired people, using image recognition and machine learning.

The app aim to determine the color and the type of clothing on a picture.

The easiest way for me at the moment, was to deploy the app using the Streamlit framework, but not yet on the Streamlit Cloud.
